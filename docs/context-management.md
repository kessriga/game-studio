# Context Management

Keep the current task and its evidence within your assistant's available context.
Save progress in files so work can continue after a summary or a new session.

## File-Backed State (Primary Strategy)

**The file is the memory, not the conversation.** Conversations are ephemeral and
will be compacted or lost. Files on disk persist across compactions and session crashes.

### Session State File

Maintain `production/session-state/active.md` as a living checkpoint. Update it
after each significant milestone:

- Design section approved and written to file
- Architecture decision made
- Implementation milestone reached
- Test results obtained

The state file should contain: current task, progress checklist, key decisions
made, files being worked on, and open questions.

### Active Work Block (Production+ only)

When the project is in Production, Polish, or Release stage, include a structured
status block in `active.md` that `gamedev:status` can report:

```markdown
<!-- STATUS -->
Epic: Combat System
Feature: Melee Combat
Task: Implement hitbox detection
<!-- /STATUS -->
```

- All three fields (Epic, Feature, Task) are optional — include only what applies
- Update this block when switching focus areas
- The status skill displays it as a breadcrumb: `Combat System > Melee Combat > Implement hitbox detection`
- Remove or empty the block when no active work focus exists

After a context reset, summary, crash, or new session, read the state file first.

### Incremental File Writing

When creating multi-section documents (design docs, architecture docs, lore entries):

1. Create the file immediately with a skeleton (all section headers, empty bodies)
2. Discuss and draft one section at a time in conversation
3. Write each section to the file as soon as it's approved
4. Update the session state file after each section
5. After writing a section, previous discussion about that section can be safely
   compacted — the decisions are in the file

This keeps the context window holding only the *current* section's discussion
(~3-5k tokens) instead of the entire document's conversation history (~30-50k tokens).

## Proactive Compaction

- **Save a checkpoint early** when context is becoming full. Use the host's
  summarization controls when available; some hosts compact automatically.
- **Start a fresh session** between unrelated tasks when old context gets in the way.
- **Natural compaction points:** after writing a section to file, after committing,
  after completing a task, before starting a new topic
- **Focused summary:** name the current task, sections already written, the
  next step, and unresolved questions. Host-specific commands are covered in
  [the Claude Code guide](claude-code.md#delegation-and-session-controls).

## Context Budgets by Task Type

- Light (read/review): ~3k tokens startup
- Medium (implement feature): ~8k tokens
- Heavy (multi-system refactor): ~15k tokens

## Subagent Delegation

When host policy and user authorization permit delegation, use subagents for
bounded research or exploration. Follow [the host guide](host-runtime.md).
Return the relevant findings, evidence, and limits:

- **Use subagents** when investigating across multiple files, exploring unfamiliar code,
  or doing research that would consume >5k tokens of file reads
- **Use direct reads** when you know exactly which 1-2 files to check
- Do not rely on conversation inheritance; provide the task, inputs, and constraints explicitly

## Compaction Instructions

When context is compacted, preserve the following in the summary:

- Reference to `production/session-state/active.md` (read it to recover state)
- List of files modified in this session and their purpose
- Any architectural decisions made and their rationale
- Active Backlog tasks and their current status
- Agent invocations and their outcomes (success/failure/blocked)
- Test results (pass/fail counts, specific failures)
- Unresolved blockers or questions awaiting user input
- The current task and what step we are on
- Which sections of the current document are written to file vs. still in progress

**After compaction:** Read `production/session-state/active.md` and any files being
actively worked on to recover full context. The files contain the decisions; the
conversation history is secondary.

## Recovery After Session Crash

If a session dies ("prompt too long") or you start a new session to continue work:

1. Locate `production/session-state/active.md`. Claude's session-start hook may
   preview it; other hosts must open it explicitly.
2. Read the full state file for context
3. Read the partially-completed file(s) listed in the state
4. Continue from the next incomplete section or task

| `/test-helpers` | Generate engine-specific test helper libraries for the test suite |
| `/test-evidence-review` | Quality review of test files and manual evidence documents |
| `/test-flakiness` | Detect non-deterministic (flaky) tests from CI run logs |
| `/skill-test` | Validate skill files for structural compliance and behavioral correctness |
| `/skill-improve` | Improve a skill using a test-fix-retest loop — diagnose, propose fix, rewrite, verify |

## Production

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/bug-report` | File a bug as a Backlog task (bug label); verify/close drive its status |
| `/reverse-document` | Generate design or architecture docs from existing implementation |
| `/playtest-report` | Generate a structured playtest report or analyze existing playtest notes |

> Work items (stories, bugs, epics→milestones) live on the **Backlog board**, not
> in sprint files. There are no sprint-plan/sprint-status/retrospective/milestone-review
> skills — track and prioritise work directly on the board (continuous flow).

## Release

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/release-checklist` | Generate and validate a pre-release checklist for the current build |
| `/launch-checklist` | Complete launch readiness validation across all departments |
| `/changelog` | Auto-generate changelog from git commits and Backlog data |

| `/hotfix` | Emergency fix workflow with audit trail, bypassing the normal flow |

## Creative & Content

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/prototype` | Concept prototype — throwaway build right after brainstorm to validate core idea (Phase 1) |
| `/vertical-slice` | Pre-Production validation — production-quality end-to-end build before committing to Production (Phase 4) |
| `/localize` | Localization workflow: string extraction, validation, translation readiness |
